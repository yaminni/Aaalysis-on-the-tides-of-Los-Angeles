PROJECT TITLE : ANALYSIS ON THE TIDES OF LOS ANGELES

DESCRIPTION:

This project focuses on analyzing the tidal patterns of 
Los Angeles, aiming to uncover trends, anomalies, and influencing factors. 
By utilizing historical and real-time data from reliable sources like NOAA, 
the project involves comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, 
and the development of predictive models. The insights gained are visualized through 
interactive graphs and maps, providing a clear understanding of tidal behaviors. 
This analysis not only enhances our knowledge of Los Angeles' coastal dynamics but also aids 
in forecasting future tidal levels, offering valuable information for environmental monitoring 
and coastal management.

Features
Data Collection: Aggregates tidal data from various reliable sources, including NOAA and local monitoring stations.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensures data integrity by handling missing values, outliers, and normalizing datasets.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilizes statistical methods and visualizations to uncover patterns, correlations,
 and anomalies in the tidal data.

Predictive Modeling: Implements machine learning algorithms to forecast future tidal levels based on historical trends.

Visualizations: Provides interactive graphs and maps to represent tidal patterns and predictions effectively.

Report Generation: Summarizes findings in detailed reports, highlighting key insights and actionable information.
